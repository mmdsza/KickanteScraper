# KickanteScraper
This is a simple scraper for the crowdfunding website Kickante. 


## Prerequisites

For this script to run properly, apart from Python3, you need the packages 'BeautifulSoup4' and 'urllib3' installed on your computer or on a virtual environment (I recommend the latter).

If you don't know how to install them, here's how:
```
pip install beautifulsoup4 urllib3  
```


## How to use
Download the script, move it to a preferred location and execute the following on a terminal:
```
python kickante.py
```
## What will this do?
This will go over the first n pages of Kickante's explore page, extract the name of the campaign, how much they raised, how far from their goal they are, how many people backed the campaign, the campaign's description and their link.


## What can I do with this?
You could check for campaign frauds, look for duplicates, among other things.
